Compiler
=========================

We will build a cross compiler with the source language as Java, Target Language as MIPS and implementation language as Python.

Lexer
==========================

We have a made a lexer for the source language JAVA . The ouptut of the program is a tagged program, with the token  types appearing as comments.

Parser
==========================

Then from the above, we have made a parser and the output is a parse tree of the input program in dot format(that can be rendered using graphviz)
